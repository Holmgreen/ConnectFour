----- Game instructions -----
There are five panes, one of which contains the actual game.
The system has implemented a database which logs information about the games and the players.
The Highscore pane fetches the players who have won the most games and displays them in a list.
The Main Menu pane contains buttons that redirects to the Highscore pane or the Grid selection pane.
In the Grid selection pane, one can choose which grid size to use. The continue button redirects to the Player selection pane.
The Player selection pane is where the players are created. Create a player by writing its name and clicking the "Add player" button.
The "Start" button of the Player selection pane redirects to the Game panel, where the game begins.
Coins are dropped from above and the player who gets four coins in a row first, wins.
After a win or a draw, the game log is saved in the database.
